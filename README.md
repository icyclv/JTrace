# JTrace： A simple and lightweight Java agent for monitoring JVM

## Introduction
JTrace is a simple and lightweight Java agent for monitoring JVM. It can be used to monitor the running status of the JVM, such as CPU, memory, thread, class, GC, etc. It can also be used to monitor the running status of the application, such as the number of requests, the number of errors, the response time, etc.

项目主要参考Arthas的实现，实现了一些简单的监控功能，如监控CPU、内存、线程、类、GC等。同时也可以监控应用的运行状态，如请求数、错误数、响应时间等。
